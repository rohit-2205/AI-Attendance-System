Vision-Based Attendance System

Face Recognition, YOLOv8, Flask & React

Overview

The Vision-Based Attendance System is an AI-powered application designed to automate attendance marking in educational environments using computer vision. By combining facial recognition with YOLOv8-based uniform detection, the system ensures accurate, contactless, and proxy-free attendance.

The application follows a full-stack architecture, with a React frontend for user interaction and a Flask backend that exposes REST APIs for AI inference, validation, and attendance management.

Why This Project Matters

Traditional attendance systems are time-consuming and prone to errors or misuse. This project demonstrates how AI and computer vision can be applied to solve a real-world operational problem by improving accuracy, transparency, and efficiency while reducing manual effort.

Key Capabilities

Automated attendance using live video input

Real-time face recognition for identity verification

Uniform compliance detection using YOLOv8

RESTful backend APIs for processing and validation

React-based frontend for viewing attendance data

Contactless and scalable design

How It Works

A camera captures live video input

YOLOv8 detects uniform compliance in real time

Facial recognition verifies the individual’s identity

Attendance is recorded only when both checks succeed

Records are stored and displayed through the frontend

Technology Stack

Frontend: React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Backend: Python, Flask (REST APIs)

Computer Vision: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV

Data Storage: CSV / SQLite / MySQL
